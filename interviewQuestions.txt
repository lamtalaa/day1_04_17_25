// Interview questions

// 1. what is diff b/w var and let
Var is mutable, let is immutable.

// 2. how to create mutable and immutable variables
To create mutable we use var. to create immutable we use let.

// 3. diff b/w explicit and implicit variables
Explicit is when you declare a variable and specify its type.
Implicit is when you declare a variable and give it a value without specifying its type.

// 4. how to create optional variables
To create optional variable we use ?
Example: var number: Int?

// 5. what is optional binding
Optional binding is a way to safely unwrap an optional variable

// 6. how to unwrap optional variable
There are 3 ways to unwrap an optional variable:
1. Nil coalescing 2. If let block 3. Guard let block

// 7. diff b/w nil coalescing, if let and guard let
Nil coalescing allows you to give a default value if the optional is nil
If let block allows you to unwrap an optional and work with it inside a block
Guard let allows you to unwrap an optional and exit early if it is nil

// 8. diff b/w array and dict and set
Array is ordered and can have duplicates
Set is unordered and can not have duplicates
Dictionary has key value pairs. It is unordered and can not have duplicates

// 9. can you assign a optional value to non optional variable , if yes how , if now why?
Not you cannot because a non optional variable is expecting a valid value
While an optional variable might have a value of nil.
You can achieve this by using optional binding.
